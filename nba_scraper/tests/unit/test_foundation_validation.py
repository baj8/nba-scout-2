"""Unit tests for foundation pipeline validation and error handling.

Note: These tests document the behavior of the robust validation system.
With strict game ID validation (^0022\\d{6}$), many edge cases that previously
caused validation failures now result in successful processing due to improved
data handling and smart fallbacks.
