"""Migration contract tests for forward/backward compatibility.

This module tests that migrations:
1. Can be applied forward (upgrade) without data loss
2. Can be rolled back (downgrade) safely
3. Preserve existing data through schema changes
4. Provide clear error messages for non-reversible operations

Contract tests ensure that:
- Data survives migrations (no silent data loss)
- Schema changes are backward compatible where possible
- Breaking changes are clearly documented and handled
