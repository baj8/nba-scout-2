  - Optimize bulk insert operations

- [ ] **Monitoring Dashboard**
  - Create real-time pipeline status monitoring
  - Add data freshness indicators
  - Implement alert system for failed extractions

### 3. Data Quality & Validation
**Priority**: Medium

- [ ] **Cross-Source Validation**
  - Compare NBA.com data with Basketball Reference
  - Identify and flag data discrepancies
  - Build automated data quality reports

- [ ] **Historical Data Backfill**
  - Prioritize missing games from current season
  - Implement incremental backfill strategy
  - Add progress tracking for large backfills

## ðŸ“‹ UPCOMING TRANCHES

### Tranche 3: Hustle Stats & Defensive Metrics
**Target**: November 2025

- [ ] Hustle stats endpoint integration

- [ ] Shot tracking (closest defender, shot quality)
- [ ] Rebounding tracking (positioning, effort)
- [ ] Advanced defensive metrics

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DEBT & MAINTENANCE

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Type Safety Improvements**
  - Add comprehensive type hints to all modules
  - Implement strict mypy checking
  - Add runtime type validation for critical paths

- [ ] **Error Handling Standardization**
  - Standardize error handling patterns across extractors
  - Improve error context and logging
  - Add retry logic for transient failures

- [ ] **Testing Coverage**
  - Achieve 90%+ test coverage on core modules
  - Add integration tests for all pipelines
  - Implement property-based testing for transformers

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - Centralize all configuration in config system
  - Add environment-specific overrides
  - Implement configuration validation

- [ ] **Deployment Automation**
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - Add automated testing on pull requests
  - Implement staged deployments

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS METRICS

### Data Pipeline Health
- **Uptime Target**: 99.5% for critical extractions
- **Data Freshness**: < 4 hours for game data
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for successful API calls

### Coverage Goals
- **Current Season**: 100% game coverage
- **Historical Data**: 95% coverage back to 2015-16 season
- **Advanced Metrics**: All available endpoints integrated

## ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Tranche 1 Lessons Learned
- **Rate limiting** was crucial for NBA.com stability
- **Comprehensive upsert logic** prevented data duplication issues
- **End-to-end validation** caught integration problems early
- **Modular design** made testing and debugging much easier

### Best Practices Established
- Always test with real NBA data, not just mocks
- Build comprehensive error handling from the start
- Validate data persistence after every major change
- Use small, focused commits for easier debugging

### Architecture Decisions
- **Tranche-based approach** proved effective for incremental delivery
- **Separate extractors/transformers/loaders** maintained clean separation
- **Comprehensive testing strategy** caught issues before production
- **Configuration-driven design** made deployment flexible
